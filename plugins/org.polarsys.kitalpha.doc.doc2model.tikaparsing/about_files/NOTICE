The Apache Tika toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text content from various documents - from PPT to CSV to PDF - using existing parser libraries. Tika unifies these parsers under a single interface to allow you to easily parse over a thousand different file types. Tika is useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, 
translation, and much more. You can find the latest release on the download page.
